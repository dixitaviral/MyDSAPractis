Backtracking rule:
1. Make the answer.
2. Recurse first time with include.
3. Undo the current ans change.
4. Recurse with exclude then.

Till now there are two rules for either use loop and second recursion according to below two 
situation:
1. Combinations/Permutation: Loop.
2. Subsets/Subsequence/PowerSet: Second recursion.

But abhi naya pattern dekha gaya hai, jisme ki agar:

1. Combinations/Permutation + Duplicates element: still loop, no change.
But
2. Subsets/Subsequence/PowerSet + Duplicate elements : then use loop.

Bonus tip:

1. You might also need to sort the input first. Like combination sum or susbet 2.
